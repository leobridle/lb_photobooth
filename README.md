lb_photobooth
=============

A simple photobooth I made for a friend's wedding. It's my first ever Openframeworks project, 
so it's probably a bit of a mess, but it works, and so I'm putting it out there. The advantage over
the built in photobooth app is that the captured image is at a higher resolution (1280x720)

There are probably some more elegant ways of doing some of the effects. For example the countdown timer is rendered
as a quicktime movie, wheras it could probably be done with code.

It is setup for a 1920x1080 screen and the mac built in webcam, athough I used a logitech one which worked just as well.
